# LeafPlus

<h3>LeafPlus is a Web-App that we developed during PoliHack v10 (a local 48hrs hackathon that took place during 22-24 Nov 2019), which got us 3rd place. <br>
The idea is to help students gain experience and earn some money by using a freelancing-like platform, on which clients or investors can come and post tasks for them, in various domains (IT, Design, Photography etc.). <br>
The front-end of the app has been coded in HTML and CSS, while the back-end has been done using Java with Maven and web servlets.<br>
